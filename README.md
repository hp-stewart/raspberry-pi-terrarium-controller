# raspberry-pi-terrarium-controller
a project to monitor and control a hobby terrarium using raspberry pi. Sensors installed in the terrarium measure variables such as water and light which are transmitted to an online database. Outputs such as water and lights are turned on and off at scheduled intervals, if recent measurements indicate they are needed.
